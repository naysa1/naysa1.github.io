          <div class="About-Content"> Hey there! I'm Naysa, currently a junior at UCSC pursuing a B.S. in Technology Information Management. My world revolves around a dynamic mix of technology, creativity, and passion.
            First and foremost, I'm a gaming enthusiast. Video games aren't just a hobby for me; they're a source of inspiration and a platform for connection. I love exploring the intricacies of project management within the gaming industry, and it's this intersection of technology and creativity that truly fascinates me.
            In my academic journey, I've developed a keen interest in networking systems in end-to-end hosts. Unraveling the complexities of how our digital world stays connected is both challenging and rewarding.
            Beyond the tech realm, I find solace in art and the adrenaline of the basketball court. My hobbies are as diverse as my interests, and I believe in maintaining a balance between the analytical and the creative.
            What sets me apart is my vision for using video games as a medium to share the richness of cultures worldwide. It's not just about playing games; it's about using them to break down barriers, foster understanding, and connect with people globally. Join me on this journey of exploration, where tech meets art, and gaming becomes a bridge between diverse cultures
